# CGPA-Advisor
We have developed an app which will take input (course name course grade, credit) from the user and will evaluate the user's current cgpa. Then we will ask user to choose between 3 options (retake, retake &amp; new and only new) so that the app can advise him/her to choose which courses the user need to take in order to achieve the desired target cgpa(input also taken by user). Here we have maintained the NSU policy which is that a user canâ€™t take a course retake where he/she has achieved B+ or more. The app will advise the user so that he / she can have these options to determinate which policy will be most suited for his/her career. We also have made a gif file which will help to use the app more efficiently. The gif is also attached here.
